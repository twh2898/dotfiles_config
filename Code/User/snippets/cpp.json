	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Constructors": {
		"prefix": "constructor",
		"body": [
			"$1();",
			"",
			"$1(const $1 & other) = default;",
			"",
			"$1($1 && other) = default;",
			"",
			"$1 & operator=(const $1 & other) = default;",
			"",
			"$1 & operator=($1 && other) = default;",
		],
		"description": "Default copy and move constructor and assignment operators"
	}
